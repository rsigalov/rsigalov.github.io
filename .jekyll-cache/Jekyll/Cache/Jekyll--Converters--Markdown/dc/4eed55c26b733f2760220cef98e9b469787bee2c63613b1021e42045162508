<h3 id="brief-overview">Brief Overview</h3>

<p>The code generates disaster measure introduced in <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/16-061_797fe134-9faa-4a5f-be41-1f1e5bebddcb.pdf">Siriwardane (2015)</a>. To do it
the code loads data on individual names options, fits SVI smiles into implied
volatilities and isolates the jump component following

Prior research found that small companies are more correlated with real economic
activity. A disaster measure constructed from individual names rather than using
options of aggregate indices highlights levers this observation.
<a href="http://localhost:4000/papers/Disaster Risk Technical Appendix.pdf">Technical Appendix</a>
provides more details on estimation. <a href="http://localhost:4000/papers/Cremers JUMP and VOL factors technical details.pdf">Details on Replication of Cremers JUMP and VOL factors</a></p>

<p>In the two figures below I show how the disaster measure estimated from
individual names options (Level D) compares with disaster measure estimated from
options on S&amp;P 500 (S&amp;P 500 D) with other measures of economic activity where
CP is the Cochrane-Piazzezi (2005) factor.</p>

<p>In the Figure below I show the contribution of different industries to the
disaster measure estimated using individual names options. In
particular, elevated disaster measure during the DotCom bubble is driven
primarily by <em>Business Equipment</em> industry (tech) and in the GFC by <em>Money</em>
industry (banks and insurance companies).</p>
