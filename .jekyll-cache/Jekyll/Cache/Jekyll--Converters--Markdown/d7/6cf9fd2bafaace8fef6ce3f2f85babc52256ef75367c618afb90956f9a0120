<p>We show that reaching for yield â€“ a tendency to take more risk when the real interest rate declines
while the risk premium remains constant â€“ results from imposing a sustainable spending constraint
on an otherwise standard infinitely lived investor with power utility. This is true for two alternative
versions of the constraint which make wealth and consumption follow martingales in levels or in logs,
respectively. Reaching for yield intensifies when the interest rate is initially low, helping to explain
the salience of the topic in the current low-rate environment. The sustainable spending constraint
also affects the response of risktaking to a change in the risk premium, which can even be negative
when the riskless interest rate is sufficiently low. In a variant of the model where the sustainable
spending constraint is formulated in nominal terms, low inflation also encourages risktaking. (<a href="http://localhost:4000/papers/ReachingForYield_Appendix.pdf">Online appendix</a>, <a href="http://localhost:4000/reaching_for_yield.html">code</a>)</p>
