<p>Code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/rsigalov/disaster-risk-revision">Github</a>.</p>

<p>The code generates disaster measure introduced in <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/16-061_797fe134-9faa-4a5f-be41-1f1e5bebddcb.pdf">Siriwardane (2015)</a>. To do it
the code loads data on individual names options, fits SVI smiles into implied
volatilities and isolates the jump component following

Prior research (e.g. â€¦) found that small companies are
more correlated with real economic activity. A disaster measure constructed from
individual names rather than using options of aggregate indices highlights this
distinction.</p>

<p>Below I show the disaster measure and contribution of different sectors. In
particular, elevated disaster measure during the DotCom bubble is driven
primarily by <em>Business Equipment</em> industry (tech) and in the GFC by <em>Money</em>
industry (banks and insurance companies).
