Something here

    <p>I graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> with B.A. in Economics from New Economic School in 2017 where I received <em>Bachelor of Excellence</em> award as the highest achieving undergraduate student.</p>

<p>Before starting the graduate school I worked at the Moscow Exchange studying the behavior of market makers, in an asset management company developing high yield bonds and macro event driven strategies and in a IT company as a data analyst</p>

<p>In high school I was a competitive alpine skiing participating in Russian national championships.</p>
