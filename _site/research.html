Campbell, Journal of Financial Economics, Forthcoming)</h3>

<p>We show that reaching for yield – a tendency to take more risk when the real interest rate declines
while the risk premium remains constant – results from imposing a sustainable spending constraint
on an otherwise standard infinitely lived investor with power utility. This is true for two alternative
versions of the constraint which make wealth and consumption follow martingales in levels or in logs,
respectively. Reaching for yield intensifies when the interest rate is initially low, helping to explain
the salience of the topic in the current low-rate environment. The sustainable spending constraint
also affects the response of risktaking to a change in the risk premium, which can even be negative
when the riskless interest rate is sufficiently low. In a variant of the model where the sustainable
spending constraint is formulated in nominal terms, low inflation also encourages risktaking. (<a href="http://localhost:4000/papers/ReachingForYield_Appendix.pdf">Online appendix</a>, <a href="http://localhost:4000/reaching_for_yield.html">code</a>)</p>

<h3 id="lifecycle-of-private-equity-with-andrea-hamaui">Lifecycle of Private Equity (with Andrea Hamaui)</h3>

<p>We study the implications of the finitely-lived structure of
Private Equity funds on their risk and performance. We find that
younger funds are well insulated against large
economic shocks such as the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, while
their older counterparts’ performance is significantly affected.
We use the estimates of the effect of an economic shock on
Private Equity cash flows and a standard rare disaster model
to value a commitment claim along the lifecycle of a fund. There we
find that the total payoff – the sum of cash flows and change in
value of the commitment – and thus the risk are hump-shaped in the
age of a fund. We then study the real decisions behind funds
cash flows: deals and exits. We first find that funds whose LPs
have higher than the average expenses reduce their capital calls.
Higher operating profitability of publicly traded comparables
that proxy for operating profitability of portfolio companies and
higher aggregate valuation ratios are associated with higher
probability of exit from a fund’s investment. Moreover, this
effect gets stronger with the time from the investments and thus
with fund’s age.</p>
