I graduated *summa cum laude* with B.A. in Economics from New Economic School in 2017 where I received *Bachelor of Excellence* award as the highest achieving undergraduate student.

Before starting the graduate school I worked at the Moscow Exchange studying the behavior of market makers, in an asset management company developing high yield bonds and macro event driven strategies and in a IT company as a data analyst

In high school I was a competitive alpine skiing participating in Russian national championships.
