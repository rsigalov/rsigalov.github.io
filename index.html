<p>
  I am a Quantitave Researcher at an Asset Management firm and a Research Associate at the Economics Department of Harvard University. I graduated with a PhD in Economics from Harvard in May 2023 where I focused on research in Finance.
</p>

<p>
    In my research, I apply dynamic optimization and high performance computing techniques to study asset pricing. I show how firm fundamentals affect option prices, analyze pricing of jump risk in the cross-section of equity stock returns, and show implications of time-series movements of index option for macro-finance models. You can learn more about my research

</p>

<p>
  Prior to pursuing my PhD, I graduated at the top of my class with a B.A. in Economics from the New Economic School in 2017. In the past, I was a competitive alpine skier and participated in the Russian National Championships.
